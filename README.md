# Copyright-Adventure-2
the second installment of the copyright adventure franchise

My second ever game!
Made this to learn GUIs.
Uses javafx, so incompatible with some java versions.
**Run with Java 8.**

Copyright Adventure 2 is a point and click rpg about battling beloved characters (and some of my friends) and recruiting them into your team.
Find out which matchups would benefit you and try to get as many members as you can before the boss fights!

Features characters, music, and sounds from everyone's favorite copyrighted franchises and art from my friends, Google images (at one part) and myself.

Download the jar file from Google Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pEUUaGZjLCpJ6I1l0vNkhutck7LaSp8J/view?usp=sharing) and run with command: `java -jar 'CopyrightAdventure2 (v1.01).jar'`.
