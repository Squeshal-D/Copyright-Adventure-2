# Copyright-Adventure-2
the second installment of the copyright adventure franchise

My second ever game!
Made this to learn GUIs.
Uses javafx, so incompatible with some java versions.
Run with Java 8.

Crashes sometimes, but I'm not sure why.
Only crashes when I run an exported version and I have no error log.
I think I may have messed up with the thread philosophy, and it'll try to display stuff that hasn't been made yet.
